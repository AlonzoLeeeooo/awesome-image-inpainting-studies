# References

In `reference.bib`, bibtex references of up-to-date image inpainting papers, widely used datasets, and toolkits are summarized.
Based on the original references, I have made the following modifications to make their results look nice in the `LaTeX` manuscripts:
- All refereces are constructed in the form of `author-etal-year-nickname`.
- In each reference, all names of conferences/journals are converted into abbreviations, e.g., `{IEEE/CVF} Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition -> CVPR`.
- The `url`, `doi`, `publisher`, `organization` in all references are removed.
- The `pages` of all references are added if they are missing.
- All paper names are in title case. Besides, I have added an additional `{}` to make sure that the title case would also work well in some particular templates. 

If you have other demands of reference formats, you may refer to the original references of papers by searching their names in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).
